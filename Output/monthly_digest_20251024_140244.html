                            MONTHLY_DIGEST: Executive Summary<br>Over the past month, Nordic marketers operated against a backdrop of steady consumer demand in Sweden, sustained interest in retail media, and continued privacy and measurement shifts. Retail media remains a high‑priority test bed across the region, aligning with broader global momentum and underpinned by strong retail fundamentals in Sweden [1][2][3][4]. On the tooling side, martech stacks continue to absorb AI‑enabled capabilities while consolidating legacy overlap, according to 2025 market mapping [5]. Privacy and consent remained central, with Swedish and Norwegian regulators’ guidance shaping cookie practices and consent UX, and the UK CMA’s ongoing oversight of Google’s Privacy Sandbox keeping measurement and attribution strategies in flux [6][7][8][9][10]. Premium Nordic publishers and broadcasters (Schibsted, Bonnier News, TV4, Viaplay) emphasized brand‑safe reach and data‑driven ad products, while commerce‑adjacent platforms, notably Klarna, stayed in focus given their scale with Nordic consumers [11][12][13][14][15]. Overall, October’s signal for the Nordics: keep aligning growth activity to first‑party data, privacy‑safe addressability, and accountable performance across retail media, premium publisher ecosystems, and CTV.<br><br>Main body<br>- Retail media momentum continues to define near‑term growth plays. Global analysis points to accelerating investment in retailer‑operated ad platforms and new screens across categories, not just grocery, a pattern highly relevant to Nordic retail groups building audience and onsite/offsite monetization [1]. For Nordic consumer brands, this aligns with the broader shift toward commerce‑signal‑rich channels, supported by changing shopper behaviors captured in 2025 consumer research [2].<br><br>- Swedish retail demand offers a supportive context for performance activation. Sweden’s retail sales rose 4.4% YoY in August 2025, with models pointing to moderation but continued growth into autumn, providing marketers with a relatively stable base for Q4 testing and optimization [3]. Broader market context from Sweden’s retail guide highlights structural strengths—innovation capacity, digital adoption, and ease of doing business—helpful for scaling new media and data solutions [4].<br><br>- Martech stack evolution: more AI, more rationalization. The 2025 Marketing Technology Landscape recorded 15,384 solutions (+9% YoY), with AI‑native tools scaling while earlier‑generation categories consolidate [5]. Nordic teams evaluating October budget pivots and 2026 planning are balancing AI‑driven efficiency (creative, analytics, orchestration) with stack simplification to reduce redundancy and improve signal quality.<br><br>- Consent, cookies, and CMP rigor remain front‑and‑center in the Nordics. Sweden’s IMY provides clear requirements for cookie usage and consent design, including transparency and user choice standards [6]. Norway’s Datatilsynet reinforces similar expectations, underscoring the need for compliant consent mechanisms across high‑traffic properties [7]. For cross‑market activation, alignment with IAB Europe’s TCF remains foundational for lawful processing and signal interoperability with ad tech partners [8].<br><br>- Measurement and attribution are reshaped by continued Privacy Sandbox oversight. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) continues to scrutinize Google’s browser‑level changes, keeping pressure on alternative addressability and attribution methods [9]. Google’s Privacy Sandbox documentation sets out evolving APIs for interest‑based advertising and conversion measurement, affecting how Nordic advertisers calibrate post‑cookie tactics [10].<br><br>- Premium Nordic publishers emphasize first‑party reach and safer environments. Schibsted’s advertising ecosystem (spanning leading news and marketplace properties) and Bonnier News’ portfolio both promote scaled, brand‑safe inventory with data‑driven segments—an important counterweight to walled gardens as cookies deprecate [12][13]. These offerings are salient this quarter as marketers seek quality reach, contextual relevance, and better accountability in privacy‑first environments.<br><br>- CTV and premium streaming gain operational traction. TV4 and Viaplay Group continue to develop ad formats and audience solutions that blend TV‑grade attention with digital measurability [14][15]. For Nordic marketers, this creates opportunities to complement social video with premium environments and to connect upper‑funnel exposure to mid‑funnel and commerce outcomes via site and retail media signals.<br><br>- Commerce‑adjacent platforms stay in the spotlight. Klarna’s path toward an IPO, highlighted in September, underscores the scale of fintech‑commerce ecosystems engaging Nordic consumers at consideration and checkout moments [11]. While the IPO news is financial, it contextualizes the relevance of high‑intent digital surfaces in the region’s performance mix.<br><br>- Retail market structure supports further retail media development. Sweden’s national context—strong digital adoption and openness to international players—helps explain why brands and retailers are accelerating commercialization of shopper data and onsite search/display in the Nordics [4]. Within grocery, the scale of leading chains such as ICA (illustrated by regional revenue distribution data) highlights the audience potential for maturing retail media propositions [16].<br><br>- Consumer behavior trends shape channel mix and creative. Broader 2025 consumer research points to continued shifts in time spent, value orientation, and digital habits, reinforcing the case for granular audience segmentation, contextually aligned creative, and commerce‑linked placements that can demonstrate incremental outcomes [2]. These dynamics are playing out in October planning cycles as marketers balance brand building with accountable short‑term performance.<br><br>- The addressability stack is diversifying. With third‑party cookies constrained and regulatory expectations clear, Nordic teams are increasingly using combinations of consented first‑party identifiers, publisher first‑party data, contextual signals, and model‑based measurement (MMM, geo experiments)—a trend supported by TCF‑aligned practices and Sandbox testing [8][9][10][12][13][14][15]. October discussions across the ecosystem concentrated on how to maintain precision without over‑reliance on any single signal.<br><br>- Creative and format innovation are becoming differentiators. As publisher and CTV environments roll out richer ad products, Nordic advertisers are leveraging creative variants tailored to context and funnel stage to extract more value from premium inventory [14][15]. In parallel, AI features in martech tools are improving creative iteration velocity and insight generation, provided teams rationalize stacks to avoid noise [5].<br><br>- Economic and market signals support pragmatic growth bets. With Sweden’s retail sales data pointing to ongoing, if moderating, growth, and with robust digital infrastructure and talent, Nordic marketers in October concentrated spend where measurement is credible—retail media, premium publisher ecosystems, and CTV—while ensuring consent UX and data policy adherence to protect durable performance [3][4][6][7][8].<br><br>Source References<br>1) <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/exploring-the-retail-media-landscape-what-to-expect-in-2025-f47c7127" target="_blank">https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/exploring-the-retail-media-landscape-what-to-expect-in-2025-f47c7127</a><br>2) <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/how-todays-consumers-are-spending-their-time-and-money" target="_blank">https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/how-todays-consumers-are-spending-their-time-and-money</a><br>3) <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/retail-sales-annual" target="_blank">https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/retail-sales-annual</a><br>4) <a href="https://press.stockholmbusinessregion.com/press-release/retail-guide-sweden-2024-2025-your-key-to-the-nordic-market/" target="_blank">https://press.stockholmbusinessregion.com/press-release/retail-guide-sweden-2024-2025-your-key-to-the-nordic-market/</a><br>5) <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2025/05/2025-marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-100x-growth-since-2011-but-now-with-ai/" target="_blank">https://chiefmartec.com/2025/05/2025-marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-100x-growth-since-2011-but-now-with-ai/</a><br>6) <a href="https://www.imy.se/lagar--regler/kakor-cookies/" target="_blank">https://www.imy.se/lagar--regler/kakor-cookies/</a><br>7) <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/rettigheter-og-plikter/informasjonskapsler/" target="_blank">https://www.datatilsynet.no/rettigheter-og-plikter/informasjonskapsler/</a><br>8) <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/tcf/" target="_blank">https://iabeurope.eu/tcf/</a><br>9) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes</a><br>10) <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/" target="_blank">https://privacysandbox.com/</a><br>11) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-09/klarna-is-said-to-guide-us-ipo-pricing-above-marketing-range" target="_blank">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-09/klarna-is-said-to-guide-us-ipo-pricing-above-marketing-range</a><br>12) <a href="https://schibsted.com/advertising/" target="_blank">https://schibsted.com/advertising/</a><br>13) <a href="https://www.bonniernews.se/en/advertising/" target="_blank">https://www.bonniernews.se/en/advertising/</a><br>14) <a href="https://www.tv4.se/annons/" target="_blank">https://www.tv4.se/annons/</a><br>15) <a href="https://viaplaygroup.com/advertising/" target="_blank">https://viaplaygroup.com/advertising/</a><br>16) <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1063163/revenue-of-ica-retail-stores-in-sweden-by-region/" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1063163/revenue-of-ica-retail-stores-in-sweden-by-region/</a>
