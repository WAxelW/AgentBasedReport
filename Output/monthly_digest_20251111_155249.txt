Report on MarTech trends for November 2025
============================================================

MONTHLY_DIGEST: 
Executive Summary
November 2025 in Nordic MarTech was defined by a dual track: continued momentum behind retail media and first‑party data activation, alongside heightened scrutiny of data security. In Sweden, retail platform advertising is projected to expand further in 2025, supported by the country’s position as the Nordic retail engine and a still‑supportive consumer backdrop into Q4 2025. European advertisers are deepening partnerships with retail media networks, while global outlooks for the 2025 holiday period and category‑specific pressures in fashion continue to push marketers toward measurable performance and efficient growth. A notable development this month was Klarna’s disclosure of a customer data issue, reinforcing the importance of trust, consent, and robust data governance across Nordic MarTech stacks. Overall, the market context points to sustained investment in retail media, CRM, and AI‑enabled orchestration heading into 2026, with an emphasis on closed‑loop measurement and customer lifetime value.

Main body
- Data security in focus: On November 5, Klarna confirmed a customer data issue, drawing attention to safeguards around first‑party data and consent within Nordic commerce and MarTech ecosystems. The disclosure underscores operational and reputational stakes for platforms using identity and purchase data for advertising and personalization. [12]

- Nordic fintech/commercial signals: Klarna invited shareholder questions ahead of its Q3 2025 results on November 18, signaling investor interest in growth levers across payments, shopping, and media monetization. While not a performance disclosure in itself, the timing highlights market scrutiny of platforms sitting at the intersection of commerce data and advertising. [13]

- Retail platform advertising outlook in Sweden: Ad spending in retail platform advertising is projected to reach approximately US$674.17 million in 2025, indicating continued channel maturation and budget allocation to retailer‑owned inventory and off‑site extensions. Definitions on this source clarify the scope across retailer websites and apps. [2]

- Retail media revenue trajectory: Sweden’s digital retail media advertising revenue increased between 2022 and 2024, providing a baseline for ongoing growth into 2025. This arc supports the narrative of retail media moving from experimental to established within Swedish media mixes. [1]

- Swedish consumer backdrop: Sweden’s retail sales rose 4.3% year‑on‑year in September 2025. While a monthly data point, it suggests demand held into Q4, a supportive context for activation‑heavy channels such as retail media and performance marketing through the peak season. [5]

- Sweden’s regional leadership: The Retail Guide Sweden 2024–2025 highlights Sweden’s position with the highest retail turnover in the Nordic region. This structural advantage continues to make Sweden a primary launchpad for Nordic retail media initiatives and data‑driven partnerships. [3]

- European RMN adoption: Across Europe, advertisers partnering with retail media networks expanded through 2024 and into 2025, signaling channel maturity, broader category participation, and rising expectations for standardized buying and closed‑loop reporting. [10]

- Nordic e‑commerce context: Nordic e‑commerce revenue growth showed volatility through 2024, creating an operational backdrop where marketers prioritize channels with clear demand capture and attributable sales impact—often retail media, paid search, and CRM‑led journeys. [6]

- Global retail media playbooks for 2025: Industry analysis points to retail media networks sharpening their offerings—improving measurement, creative services, and buying standardization—to compete for brand budgets in 2025. Nordic retailers and marketplaces are likely to mirror these moves to attract multinational advertisers. [7]

- Holiday trading signal: Forrester expects 2025 US holiday retail sales to outperform the prior two years. While US‑specific, this serves as a directional indicator for promotional intensity, retail media demand, and the emphasis on measurable sales outcomes in multinational media plans that touch the Nordics. [8]

- Fashion category outlook: The State of Fashion 2025 highlights sustained cost pressures and uneven demand. Nordic fashion players operating globally are likely to maintain an emphasis on performance rigor, retention, and contribution margin when deploying MarTech and retail media budgets. [9]

- AI shaping MarTech stacks: Research ahead of Martech Day 2025 underscores rapid adoption of AI across orchestration, content, and analytics, reshaping how marketers integrate first‑party data and automate execution. This continues to influence Nordic MarTech roadmaps as teams seek scalable personalization and measurement. [11]

- Swedish retail market insight: Business Sweden, together with the Swedish Retail Institute (HUI), provides contemporary perspectives on developments in the Swedish retail market—useful context for MarTech planning around omnichannel, customer engagement, and category dynamics. [4]

- Nordic digital commerce trendline: Broader Nordic digital commerce metrics for 2024 show that quarter‑to‑quarter performance has been uneven. This backdrop helps explain why marketers in November 2025 remain focused on channels with robust incrementality testing and closed‑loop sales attribution. [6]
